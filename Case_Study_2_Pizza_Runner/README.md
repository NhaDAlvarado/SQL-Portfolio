# Pizza Runner Case Study

## Introduction

As a data enthusiast, I am always looking for real-world projects that allow me to dive deeper into SQL and apply my skills to meaningful, hands-on tasks. When I came across this Pizza Runner case study, created by Danny Ma, I was immediately intrigued. Not only because it revolves around pizza (who doesn't love pizza?), but also because it presents a challenge that combines various aspects of data analysis such as customer behavior, delivery logistics, and operational efficiencyâ€”all key areas I wanted to improve my skills in.

## Why I Chose This Case Study

I wanted to push myself with more complex SQL queries while solving practical business problems. Pizza Runner allowed me to:

- Work with **messy data** (which is all too common in real-life projects).
- Develop insights related to **customer ordering patterns**, **delivery performance**, and **ingredient optimization**.
- Learn to clean data, handle null values, and optimize queries for reporting and metrics generation.
- Get a feel for how data can be used to **optimize operational efficiency**, particularly in an on-demand delivery service model.

## Key Learnings

Through this case study, I was able to:

- Use SQL to generate **pizza metrics** such as the number of pizzas ordered, unique customers, and the most popular types of pizzas.
- Analyze **runner performance** by calculating average delivery times and distances.
- Explore customer behavior, especially how changes in pizza toppings (exclusions and extras) impacted the overall delivery.
- Optimize ingredient usage by identifying which toppings were most frequently added or excluded from orders.
- Work on pricing and profitability analysis, factoring in ingredient costs and delivery logistics.

This case study sharpened my skills in dealing with relational databases and writing SQL queries to answer very specific business questions. It was an excellent opportunity to simulate a real-world data scenario, which made it both challenging and rewarding.

## Case Study Questions

Some of the key questions I tackled in this case study include:

- How many pizzas were ordered and what types?
- What was the average time for delivery by each runner?
- Which ingredients were most commonly excluded or added as extras?
- How would pricing change if we added costs for extras like cheese?

I also enjoyed working on **bonus questions**, like calculating how much revenue Pizza Runner generated and how we could integrate a new ratings system into the current data model.

## Conclusion

This case study was not only a fun project but also an excellent learning experience. It allowed me to experiment with SQL queries in a dynamic and slightly chaotic business model, giving me a real taste of what it's like to work with actual data in the world of fast-paced, on-demand delivery services.
