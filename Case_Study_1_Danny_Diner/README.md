# Danny's Diner Case Study

## Why I Chose This Case Study

I decided to take on the **Danny's Diner** case study as part of my journey to deepen my SQL skills and apply them to real-world business scenarios. The concept of helping a small restaurant analyze its customer data, improve its loyalty program, and boost customer engagement resonated with me. It’s not just about querying data — it’s about translating that data into meaningful insights that can make a difference in a business’s success. That challenge is what drew me in.

I saw this as a perfect opportunity to blend my technical skills with problem-solving and learn how data-driven decisions can directly impact business strategies.

## What I Learned

Working through this case study, I learned how to:

- **Analyze customer behavior** using SQL, including their spending patterns and favorite dishes.
- **Calculate key business metrics** like total customer spend, most popular menu items, and visit frequency.
- **Work with joined datasets** efficiently by connecting sales, menu, and membership information to answer deeper business questions.
- **Develop a point system**, which simulates real-world loyalty programs by assigning different points based on customer purchases and membership status.
- **Think strategically**, helping a business use data to determine whether a loyalty program expansion would be beneficial and how to tailor promotions to their best customers.

These exercises gave me hands-on experience in applying SQL beyond just querying data but really **creating value through insights** that can be actioned by business leaders.

## The Case Study Breakdown

Danny’s Diner has provided three key datasets:

1. **sales** – Tracks each customer’s purchases by order date and menu item.
2. **menu** – Contains the product names and prices of the menu items.
3. **members** – Details when each customer joined Danny’s loyalty program.

### Case Study Questions

Danny wants to answer several questions about his customers:

1. What is the total amount each customer spent?
2. How many days did each customer visit?
3. What was the first item purchased by each customer?
4. What is the most purchased item, and how many times was it purchased?
5. What is the most popular item for each customer?
6. Which item was first purchased after becoming a loyalty member?
7. Which item was purchased just before becoming a member?
8. What are the total items and amount spent before a customer joined the loyalty program?
9. How many points would each customer have, considering a $1-to-10-points ratio and special point multipliers for certain items?
10. How many points do customer A and B have by the end of January after earning 2x points for a week after joining?

### Bonus Questions

Danny also wants to create summary tables for easier access:

- One that combines **sales, menu, and membership** data.
- Another that **ranks customer product purchases**, excluding those made before membership.

## Why This Case Study Matters

This case study isn't just about mastering SQL, but also about understanding how data can be used to improve customer experience and loyalty. It taught me how to connect data insights to business growth strategies, something I can apply in real-world situations.
