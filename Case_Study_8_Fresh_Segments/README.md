# Fresh Segments Case Study

## Introduction

This project is part of Danny Ma's Data With Danny case study series, focusing on Fresh Segments, a digital marketing agency that helps businesses analyze trends in online ad click behavior for their unique customer base.

The goal of this case study is to analyze aggregated interest metrics from a specific client of Fresh Segments and uncover valuable insights. Fresh Segments provides rankings and compositions of different interests based on customer interactions with online assets, offering a clear view of what interests drive the most engagement.

## Why I Chose This Project

I’m passionate about data analysis and intrigued by the intersection of marketing and data. The idea of using data to decipher customer interests and behavior is both fascinating and valuable for any business. This project is an opportunity to expand my skills in SQL and data analysis while also learning more about the digital marketing landscape.

By working on this case study, I aim to refine my approach to data cleaning, exploration, and deriving insights. I also want to push my problem-solving abilities by tackling open-ended business questions, something that deeply resonates with my desire to provide meaningful, actionable insights through data.

## What I Learned

Through this case study, I’ve learned to work with real-world datasets, handle missing values, and perform different types of joins to ensure the accuracy of the data analysis. The project helped me strengthen my SQL skills, especially in areas of data transformation, aggregation, and building meaningful metrics to answer business-driven questions.

I also gained a better understanding of customer segmentation and how businesses can leverage data to refine their marketing strategies. It's not just about numbers—it's about telling a story through the data.

## Available Data

This case study includes two key datasets:

1. **Interest Metrics**: Aggregated metrics about customer interactions with different interests. Each record represents performance metrics like composition, index value, ranking, and percentile ranking for a particular interest_id.

2. **Interest Map**: A table that maps interest_id to its relevant details, like the interest name and summary.

## Case Study Questions

The questions in this case study cover key areas like:

- Data exploration and cleansing
- Interest analysis
- Segment analysis
- Index analysis

These questions require both straightforward SQL queries and open-ended business logic to derive insights for the Fresh Segments team.

## Tools

For this analysis, I’ve primarily used PostgreSQL for running the queries and analyzing the data.

## Next Steps

I plan to build on the insights derived from this case study by continuing to explore customer segmentation and marketing data. I’m excited to take the lessons from this project and apply them to other real-world datasets.
