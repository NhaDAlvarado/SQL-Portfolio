/*
Write a single SQL script that combines all of the previous questions into a scheduled 
report that the Balanced Tree team can run at the beginning of each month to calculate 
the previous monthâ€™s values.

Imagine that the Chief Financial Officer (which is also Danny) has asked for all of 
these questions at the end of every month.

He first wants you to generate the data for January only - but then he also wants you to 
demonstrate that you can easily run the samne analysis for February without many changes 
(if at all).

Feel free to split up your final outputs into as many tables as you need - but be sure 
to explicitly reference which table outputs relate to which question for full marks :)
