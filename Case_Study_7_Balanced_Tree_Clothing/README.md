# Balanced Tree Clothing Co. Case Study

## Introduction

The **Balanced Tree Clothing Company** case study, created by Danny Ma, explores the analysis of sales performance for a modern fashion brand. I was drawn to this case study because of my passion for data analysis and my interest in learning how to generate business insights from sales data, which is critical for driving decision-making in any organization.

As I worked through this case study, I aimed to develop my SQL skills further, understand how to optimize merchandising strategies, and apply data analysis to generate financial reports. I found the structure of the questions and challenges to be a great way to sharpen my ability to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets.

## Available Data

The case study provides four datasets, though only two are needed for most questions:

- **Product Details:** Contains information about all products sold.
- **Sales:** Tracks all transactions including quantity, price, discounts, and more.
- **Product Hierarchy:** Used for the bonus challenge to understand product categories and styles.
- **Product Prices:** Also part of the bonus challenge to recreate the product details table.

## Key Insights and Learnings

1. **High-Level Sales Analysis**

   - Total quantity sold for all products.
   - Total revenue generated before discounts.
   - Total discount amount applied.

2. **Transaction Analysis**

   - Unique transactions.
   - Product purchase behavior in each transaction (including percentile values for revenue).
   - Member vs. non-member transaction performance.

3. **Product Analysis**
   - Top-selling products and their contributions to revenue.
   - Sales performance by product category and segment.
   - Transaction penetration for each product.

Through answering these questions, I gained hands-on experience with SQL queries and learned how to approach financial reporting in a business setting.

## Bonus Challenge

I also enjoyed tackling the **Bonus Challenge**, where I learned how to use recursive CTEs to transform hierarchical data and recreate the product details table. This task pushed me to think about more advanced SQL techniques, helping to build my confidence in handling real-world data transformations.

This case study was both challenging and rewarding, providing valuable insights into the fashion industry and honing my data analysis skills. I'm excited to apply these learnings in future projects!
