## Introduction

Clique Bait isn’t your typical online seafood store. It merges the founder’s passion for data analytics with his venture into the seafood industry. In this case study, I had the opportunity to help Danny, the CEO, by analyzing data to uncover insights and calculate funnel fallout rates for the Clique Bait online store.

As someone passionate about data analysis and constantly striving to expand my knowledge, I was drawn to this case study because it provided real-world data scenarios involving user behavior and digital funnels. I approached this project eager to learn more about how data can drive business decisions and improve marketing strategies.

## Available Data

The study included 5 interconnected datasets that helped track user behavior on the website:

- **Users**: Contains data about visitors, tagged by their cookie_id.
- **Events**: Logs of user activities (e.g., page views, cart adds, purchases).
- **Event Identifier**: Identifies types of events like page views, ad impressions, and purchases.
- **Campaign Identifier**: Details of 3 campaigns run on the website in 2020.
- **Page Hierarchy**: Describes the website structure, including pages and product categories.

## What I Learned

This case study allowed me to explore:

1. **Funnel Analysis**: Tracking conversions from page views to purchases, and identifying areas where customers dropped off.
2. **Campaign Effectiveness**: Analyzing how different campaigns influenced user behavior and purchase decisions.
3. **Data Integration**: Combining multiple tables to generate a comprehensive view of user interactions and campaign performance.

## Key Case Study Questions

### 1. **Data Exploration**

- How many users visited the site and how many cookies did they use?
- What was the percentage of visits that led to a purchase?
- Which products were most viewed and purchased?

### 2. **Product Funnel Analysis**

- How often were products viewed, added to carts, and abandoned?
- Which product categories had the highest conversion rates from view to purchase?

### 3. **Campaigns Analysis**

- How did different campaigns affect user activity and conversions?
- Was there a correlation between ad impressions, clicks, and purchases?

## Why I Chose This Case Study

I chose this case study because it integrates my passion for data analysis with real-world e-commerce challenges. It allowed me to apply my SQL skills to analyze customer journeys and understand how marketing campaigns can impact sales. I loved the challenge of optimizing the funnel and gaining insights into user behavior patterns.
